# Abstract {#sec:abstract}

This paper documents `template_prose_project`, the prose-focused exemplar of the [Research Project Template](https://github.com/docxology/template). It pairs the template's two-layer architecture with the [prose analysis infrastructure](https://github.com/docxology/template/tree/main/infrastructure/prose) (readability metrics, structural outline, editorial quality flags) and the [reference validation infrastructure](https://github.com/docxology/template/tree/main/infrastructure/reference) (BibTeX validation), demonstrating that **rigorous editorial review can be expressed as a configurable, deterministic pipeline** with no novel domain algorithm of its own.

A single `manuscript/config.yaml` defines target grade-level bands, citation-density floors, structural rules (every section has an H1, no heading levels skipped), and bibliography-consistency policy. The pipeline reads the manuscript, runs the prose analysers, cross-checks every `[@key]` citation against `manuscript/references.bib`, evaluates the configured checks, and writes a deterministic markdown review report alongside three figures (per-file word counts, readability metrics, citation density) and a JSON `manuscript_report.json` suitable for CI artefacts.

**Run snapshot.** The current configuration analyses 8 file(s) totalling 1742 words across 86 sentence(s) and 64 paragraph(s). Average Flesch-Kincaid grade level is 15.93; average Gunning Fog index is 16.69; the manuscript references 6 unique citation key(s); the longest section is 413 words and the shortest is 17. These numbers are auto-substituted by `scripts/z_generate_manuscript_variables.py` after every run, so the abstract tracks the JSON outputs in `output/`.

The contribution is methodological and architectural: a *generic, reusable* prose-quality module (`infrastructure/prose/`) that any project in the template can opt into, plus a *minimal, configurable* exemplar (`projects/templates/template_prose_project/`) that wires it to the bibliography and the manuscript pipeline.

**Keywords:** prose analysis, readability, editorial review, reproducible manuscript review, scientific infrastructure

# Introduction {#sec:introduction}

Editorial review is one of the longest-lived bottlenecks in scientific writing — and an obvious target for the kind of *reproducible computational workflow* advocated by [@peng2011reproducible]. A working draft accumulates structural drift (skipped heading levels, sections that have grown to 2,000 words while their siblings sit at 200), readability drift (a once-clean introduction now reads at the Gunning Fog level of a legal contract [@gunning1952technique]), and citation drift (`[@key]` references that no longer exist in `references.bib`, or bibliography entries that nobody actually cites). The traditional remedy — a senior co-author re-reading the manuscript with [@strunk2000elements] in hand — is slow, non-reproducible, and impossible to apply continuously.

`template_prose_project` exists to demonstrate that the editorial-review pass can be expressed as a **deterministic, configurable, infrastructure-backed pipeline**. This project carries no novel research contribution of its own; its purpose is to show how to compose existing template infrastructure into a complete, reproducible editorial workflow.

The architecture is simple. `manuscript/config.yaml` defines policy: target grade-level band, citation-density floor, heading-structure rules, bibliography-consistency policy. `src/pipeline/__init__.py::run_prose_pipeline` reads the manuscript directory, calls [`infrastructure.prose.analyze_manuscript`](../../../../infrastructure/prose/SKILL.md) to produce a `ManuscriptReport`, cross-checks the cited keys against [`infrastructure.reference.citation.parse_bibfile`](../../../../infrastructure/reference/citation/SKILL.md) for the `references.bib`, evaluates each configured check, and writes a markdown review report alongside JSON artefacts and three figures. None of this is project-specific: a different project can re-use the same infrastructure with a different `config.yaml` and a different manuscript directory.

The remainder of this paper documents the methodology ([@sec:methodology]), the run-time results on the bundled manuscript ([@sec:results]), and the architectural lessons drawn from wiring prose analysis through the template pipeline ([@sec:conclusion]).

# Methodology {#sec:methodology}

The pipeline runs in five stages, each a pure function in the project's `src/` modules; the orchestrator script in `scripts/` does only argument parsing and filesystem I/O.

## Read

`infrastructure.prose.read_manuscript_dir` walks the configured manuscript directory and returns a sorted `{filename: text}` mapping. Scaffolding files (`preamble.md`, `config.yaml.example`, `AGENTS.md`, `README.md`, `SYNTAX.md`) are excluded by default — they hold infrastructure documentation rather than manuscript prose.

## Analyse

For each file, three analysers run in parallel:

* **Metrics** (`infrastructure.prose.analysis.metrics`) — word, sentence, paragraph, syllable counts; average words per sentence; average syllables per word; complex-word fraction; Flesch Reading Ease [@flesch1948new]; Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level [@kincaid1975derivation]; Gunning Fog Index [@gunning1952technique]. The implementations are textbook formulae over a vowel-group syllable heuristic; they're good enough for a writer-facing signal, not for linguistic research.

* **Structure** (`infrastructure.prose.analysis.structure`) — heading outline, per-section word counts, max heading depth, presence of an H1, detection of skipped heading levels (e.g. an H1 followed directly by an H3).

* **Quality** (`infrastructure.prose.analysis.quality`) — passive-voice candidates (heuristic: "be" form + past participle), hedge-word density, citation density (Pandoc-style `[@key]` extraction), long-sentence flagging.

The results are aggregated into a `ManuscriptReport` whose JSON form is small, greppable, and diff-friendly.

## Cross-check

Every cited key is matched against the BibTeX file at `bibliography.references_path`. The check has four tunable behaviours via `config.yaml`:

| Setting | Effect |
|---|---|
| `fail_on_missing: true` | Any cited `[@key]` that does not exist in the bib fails the check. |
| `fail_on_missing: false` | Missing citations are warned but do not fail the run. |
| `fail_on_unused: true` | Bib entries that are never cited fail the check. |
| `fail_on_unused: false` | Unused entries are warned but do not fail. |

The check uses [`infrastructure.reference.citation.parse_bibfile`](../../../../infrastructure/reference/citation/SKILL.md) so it sees exactly the same view of the bibliography that the rendering pipeline uses.

## Evaluate

The report runs through a set of pure check functions:

* `_check_grade_level` — the manuscript-wide weighted average FKGL falls within `[target_grade_level_min, target_grade_level_max]`.
* `_check_citation_density` — citations per 1000 words ≥ `citation_density_min_per_1000`.
* `_check_no_skipped_levels` — no file uses a skipped heading level (when `prose.forbid_skipped_levels: true`).
* `_check_h1_per_file` — every file has an H1 (when `prose.require_h1_per_section: true`).
* `_check_bibliography` — citation/bib consistency per the `bibliography:` policy block.

Each check produces a `CheckResult(passed, message, details)`; the run's `all_passed` flag is the conjunction.

## Render

`src/report.py::write_review_report` writes a markdown file with:

* Top-line counts (files, words, sentences, paragraphs, averages).
* A pass/fail table for every check.
* Per-file metrics table (word count, sentence count, FRE, FKGL, Fog, citations, hedges, passives).
* Heading outline per file.
* Quality-flag callouts (long sentences, passive candidates, hedges) per file.

Three orchestrators run in lexicographic order (so the figure and variable
stages always see a fresh review):

* `scripts/run_prose_pipeline.py` writes `output/manuscript_report.json`
  (the raw `ManuscriptReport`), `output/checks.json` (the list of check
  results), `output/review_report.md` (the human-readable review report),
  and `output/run_summary.json` (one-line metadata).
* `scripts/y_generate_prose_figures.py` reads `manuscript_report.json`
  and writes `../figures/{section_word_counts,readability_metrics,citation_density}.png`.
* `scripts/z_generate_manuscript_variables.py` reads `manuscript_report.json`
  + `config.yaml` and writes `output/data/manuscript_variables.json`
  along with a resolved manuscript tree under `output/manuscript/`.
* `manuscript/references.bib` is **not** modified by this pipeline — the prose project does not generate citations, only validates them.

```


# Results {#sec:results}

After running `scripts/run_prose_pipeline.py` with the bundled `manuscript/config.yaml` and the manuscript described in this paper, the project produces the following on-disk artefacts:

* `output/manuscript_report.json` — the raw `ManuscriptReport` JSON.
* `output/checks.json` — one `CheckResult` per configured check.
* `output/review_report.md` — the assembled markdown review report.
* `../figures/section_word_counts.png` — per-file word counts.
* `../figures/readability_metrics.png` — Flesch / Flesch-Kincaid / Gunning Fog per file.
* `../figures/citation_density.png` — citations per 1000 words per file.
* `output/data/manuscript_variables.json` — substitution variables for the abstract.

By design the three figures are **standalone CI/diagnostic artefacts**, not embedded manuscript images: this is a prose-review template, so its own rendered PDF deliberately contains no figure floats and runs cleanly through the very prose gate it documents. A fork that wants figures inside the manuscript should add real markdown image references to one of the produced figures (for example `../figures/section_word_counts.png`, `../figures/readability_metrics.png`, or `../figures/citation_density.png`) after those files exist.

Because the pipeline does not consult any external service, every artefact is reproducible from the manuscript text + `config.yaml` alone. A second run on the same inputs produces byte-identical JSON (modulo timestamp metadata in any caches the project later adds).

The pass/fail status of each configured check is recorded in `output/checks.json`. With the bundled configuration:

* **`grade_level_in_band`** — the weighted average FKGL across this manuscript is reported in the `output/checks.json` `details.value` field. The default band `10.0–18.0` is intentionally generous; tighten it for editorial review of public-facing material.
* **`citation_density_above_floor`** — citations per 1000 words must meet `prose.citation_density_min_per_1000`. The bundled config sets the floor to `0.0` (disabled) so the run is green out of the box; researchers should raise it to match the publication target.
* **`no_skipped_heading_levels`** — every file in this manuscript uses contiguous heading levels.
* **`every_file_has_h1`** — every prose file starts with an H1.
* **`bibliography_consistency`** — every `[@key]` in the prose resolves against `manuscript/references.bib`.

The figures in `../figures/` are colour-blind-safe (Wong 2011 palette) [@wong2011points], 300 dpi, and PNG-only for archival stability. They are referenced in [@sec:pipeline_internals] where we walk through the on-disk artefact set in full.

The full pass/fail summary lands in `output/review_report.md`, which is itself a Markdown file rendered alongside the manuscript by Pandoc — i.e. the project reports on itself in the same compilation step that produces the manuscript PDF.

# Conclusion {#sec:conclusion}

`template_prose_project` packages a complete, configurable, reproducible editorial-review workflow into the Research Project Template's two-layer architecture. By keeping prose analysis, structural validation, and bibliography cross-checking in two orthogonal infrastructure modules — `infrastructure/prose/` and `infrastructure/reference/` — the project demonstrates that *editorial discipline* is expressible as a configurable, deterministic pipeline.

This exemplar follows a single house style:

* `manuscript/config.yaml` is the only place run policy lives.
* `src/pipeline/` is the only place the project touches `infrastructure/`.
* Scripts in `scripts/` do only filesystem I/O and CLI argument handling.
* Every artefact in `output/` is regeneratable; `manuscript/references.bib` is curated and validated read-only by this project.

The contribution of this exemplar is architectural: a *generic, reusable* prose-quality module that any project in the template can opt into, and a *minimal, configurable* exemplar wiring it to the bibliography and the manuscript pipeline.

Three concrete extensions follow naturally:

1. **Style-guide enforcement** — extend `analyze_quality` with project-specific style rules (e.g. forbidden phrases, required terminology) read from `config.yaml`.
2. **Diff-aware review** — restrict the report to files modified since a given git ref so editorial review can run on every PR.
3. **LLM-assisted rewriting** — pipe long sentences and passive candidates into `infrastructure.llm` for suggested rewrites, using the same `seed=42, temperature=0.0` reproducibility contract as optional LLM stages in the template pipeline.

# Reproducibility {#sec:reproducibility}

The bundled `manuscript/config.yaml` is configured for the **strict reproducibility** discipline advocated for computational science by [@peng2011reproducible]:

1. **No network calls.** All analysis is local: prose metrics, structure, quality flags, and bibliography validation are computed from in-repo files only.
2. **Deterministic outputs.** `compute_metrics`, `analyze_structure`, and `analyze_quality` are pure functions over their input strings. The same manuscript text + the same `config.yaml` produces byte-identical JSON artefacts (modulo timestamp metadata in any caches the project later adds).
3. **Threshold transparency.** Every pass/fail decision is recorded in `output/checks.json` along with the numeric value that triggered it, so a reviewer can audit the gate without re-running the pipeline.
4. **No hidden state.** The pipeline does not mutate `manuscript/`; it reads and reports. `manuscript/references.bib` is read-only here (in contrast with the public search exemplar, where it is auto-populated).
5. **Same code, different config.** A reviewer who wants stricter standards edits `manuscript/config.yaml` (`prose.target_grade_level_max: 14.0`, say); no code changes are required.

## Verifying reproducibility locally

```bash
# Run twice; check there are no diffs in the JSON artefacts.
uv run python projects/templates/template_prose_project/scripts/run_prose_pipeline.py
mv projects/templates/template_prose_project/output projects/templates/template_prose_project/output_first
uv run python projects/templates/template_prose_project/scripts/run_prose_pipeline.py
diff -ru \
    projects/templates/template_prose_project/output_first/manuscript_report.json \
    projects/templates/template_prose_project/output/manuscript_report.json
```

The diff should be empty. If it is not, the pipeline has acquired non-determinism — file an issue.

## Determinism guarantees

| Stage | Deterministic? | Mechanism |
|---|---|---|
| Prose analysis | yes | pure functions over text |
| Bibliography parse | yes | byte-stable round-trip in `infrastructure.reference.citation` |
| Check evaluation | yes | pure comparisons |
| Markdown report assembly | yes | sorted file list, fixed output template |
| Figure generation | yes (within Matplotlib version) | fixed palette, no random subsampling |
| Manuscript variables | yes | derived from the deterministic JSON report |



```{=latex}
\newpage
```


# References {#sec:references}

Bibliography lives in [`manuscript/references.bib`](references.bib) and is read by Pandoc during PDF render. The build pipeline invokes Pandoc with `--natbib`, so every `[@key]` citation in the manuscript is rewritten to the appropriate `\cite{}`/`\citep{}`/`\citet{}` LaTeX command and resolved against the bib file.

This project does not auto-generate the bibliography — it **validates** that every `[@key]` cited in the prose has a matching entry, via [`infrastructure.reference.citation.parse_bibfile`](../../../../infrastructure/reference/citation/SKILL.md). The check policy is configured under `bibliography:` in [`config.yaml`](config.yaml).

To validate that `references.bib` is syntactically clean:

```bash
uv run python -m infrastructure.reference.citation.cli validate \
    projects/templates/template_prose_project/manuscript/references.bib --strict
```
