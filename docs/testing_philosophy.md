# Testing Philosophy: The Zero-Mock Standard

The Generalized Research Template strictly forbids mocking in
scientific/editorial validation. The prose-project test suite exemplifies
the standard: every check, every figure, every variable, and every script
is exercised against real Markdown, real BibTeX, real `tmp_path`
directories, and real subprocess invocation.

## Why Zero Mocks?

The prose project owns no algorithm of its own. Every line of `src/` is
either pure (config parsing, figure rendering, variable derivation, report
assembly) or a thin shell over `infrastructure/prose/` and
`infrastructure/reference/citation/`, which are themselves pure. There is
nothing legitimate to mock: tests can always pass real text and assert on
real outputs.

If you find yourself wanting to mock something, treat it as a signal: the
work probably belongs in `infrastructure/`, not in `src/`. Move it and
test the boundary directly.

## The Validation Suite

Files (`projects/templates/template_prose_project/tests/`):

- `test_config.py` — covers `src/config.py` typed YAML loader (23 tests).
- `test_figures.py` — covers `src/figures.py` matplotlib renderers (6 tests).
- `test_manuscript_variables.py` — covers `src/manuscript_variables.py`
  substitution (11 tests).
- `test_pipeline.py` — covers `src/pipeline/` checks and
  `run_prose_pipeline` (44 tests across `TestRunProsePipeline`,
  `TestOptionalChecks`, `TestCheckUnits` (covers every `_check_<name>` in
  isolation — `_check_grade_level`, `_check_citation_density`,
  `_check_no_skipped_levels`, `_check_h1_per_file`, `_check_bibliography`),
  `TestCitationExtractionViaPipeline`, `TestProseRunArtifacts`,
  `TestCheckResult`, `TestLongSentenceThresholdWired`).
- `test_pipeline_integration.py` — runs the bundled `manuscript/` end-to-end
  against `run_prose_pipeline` (1 test).
- `test_prose_facade.py` — covers `src/prose_facade.py` report Protocols,
  `render_outline`, and `parse_bib_keys` (16 tests).
- `test_report.py` — covers `src/report.py::write_review_report`
  (15 tests).
- `test_scripts.py` — invokes the three orchestrator scripts via
  `subprocess.run` (4 tests).

These per-file counts are a point-in-time snapshot (last verified against
`--collect-only`); the authoritative live number is always
`docs/_generated/COUNTS.md` or a fresh `--collect-only` run, not this prose.

**Live test count + achieved coverage:** see
[`docs/_generated/COUNTS.md`](../../../../docs/_generated/COUNTS.md)
(or run `uv run pytest projects/templates/template_prose_project/tests/ --collect-only -q | tail -1`).

Conftest: `projects/templates/template_prose_project/tests/conftest.py` (sets
`MPLBACKEND=Agg` at import time, adds `src/` to `sys.path`).
Configuration: `projects/templates/template_prose_project/pyproject.toml`
(`fail_under = 90`; the root pipeline gates at the same 90% number).

## Coverage

Measured line and branch coverage for `projects/templates/template_prose_project/src/` lives in
[`docs/_generated/COUNTS.md`](../../../../docs/_generated/COUNTS.md)
(exemplar table). Re-measure locally:

```bash
uv run pytest projects/templates/template_prose_project/tests/ \
    --cov=projects/templates/template_prose_project/src \
    --cov-report=term-missing \
    --cov-fail-under=90
```

Do not consume the buffer unnecessarily. Do not delete tests to make a
coverage number work — fix the gap.

## Real Inputs, Real Outputs

Every test uses real artefacts:

- **Real Markdown.** Tests write `.md` files to `tmp_path` and pass them
  through `infrastructure.prose.analyze_manuscript`. No string-faking, no
  pre-built `ManuscriptReport` objects in production-path tests.
- **Real BibTeX.** Tests covering `_check_bibliography` (emits
  `CheckResult(name="bibliography_consistency")`) write small but valid
  `.bib` files and parse them through
  `infrastructure.reference.citation.parse_bibfile`. This catches
  parser-level breakage that a mocked `BibDatabase` would hide.
- **Real `tmp_path`.** No test writes into the project's own `output/`
  tree; every filesystem operation is contained in pytest's
  `tmp_path` fixture.
- **Real subprocess.** `tests/test_scripts.py` invokes
  `scripts/run_prose_pipeline.py` and `scripts/y_generate_prose_figures.py`
  via `subprocess.run`, with real argparse, real exit codes, and real
  output-file existence checks.

## Integration Test

`tests/test_pipeline_integration.py::test_bundled_manuscript_runs` is the
end-to-end fixture: it copies the project's own `manuscript/` directory
into a temporary location, runs `run_prose_pipeline` against it, and
verifies that `manuscript_report.json`, `checks.json`, `review_report.md`,
and `run_summary.json` all land in the expected locations. The assertion
target is structural — file existence and shape — rather than exact value,
so the test is stable across editorial revisions of the bundled manuscript.

## Zero-Mock Checklist

Before submitting any test, verify all boxes are checked:

- [ ] Test uses real Markdown strings or `.md` files written to `tmp_path`.
- [ ] Test calls `src/` functions with real `ManuscriptReport`,
  `BibDatabase`, or `ProjectConfig` objects produced by infrastructure
  or by `src/config.py::load_project_config`.
- [ ] Test asserts on properties (passed/failed checks, file existence,
  field values), not on call counts.
- [ ] No `unittest.mock`, `MagicMock`, `create_autospec`, `@patch`, or
  `monkeypatch` used as a mock factory.
- [ ] Subprocess tests assert on exit codes and on the contents of files
  written by the script.

## Structural Rule: If You Need a Mock, Move the Code

The zero-mock constraint is self-enforcing when the architecture is correct:

- **`src/config.py`, `src/manuscript_variables.py`, `src/figures.py`,
  `src/report.py`, `src/prose_facade.py`** — pure modules → testable with
  real data.
- **`src/pipeline/`** — orchestrates `infrastructure.prose` and
  `infrastructure.reference.citation` → testable with real Markdown and
  real BibTeX in `tmp_path`.
- **`scripts/*.py`** — CLI shims → tested via `subprocess.run` in
  `tests/test_scripts.py`.

If you find yourself wanting to mock `analyze_manuscript`, `parse_bibfile`,
or any I/O inside a test, stop. Either pass it real data, or move the
work behind a configuration knob and test both branches with real inputs.

## Running the Gate: Collection and Threshold, Not Just Exit Code

A green exit code is **not** proof the suite ran. Two failure modes have
bitten this stack; both are now guarded, but the rule stands:

1. **Zero collected = not a pass.** `scripts/pipeline/stage_01_test.py --project
   template_prose_project` resolves the interpreter from a per-project
   `.venv`. A `.venv` created by `uv venv` without `uv sync` lacks
   `pytest`, so pytest collects nothing and a naive scorer reports
   `✓ PASSED (0/0 tests, 0.0% coverage)` with exit 0. Always confirm
   **N collected > 0 AND coverage ≥ 90%**, never exit code alone.

2. **The canonical gate is the direct command.** This is the authoritative
   per-project quality gate and what CI enforces project-by-project:

   ```bash
   uv run pytest projects/templates/template_prose_project/tests/ \
     --cov=projects/templates/template_prose_project/src --cov-fail-under=90
   ```

3. **Coverage resolves against the repo-root config.** The project's own
   `pyproject.toml` `[tool.coverage]` `source`/`omit` are *project-relative*
   and do not resolve when pytest runs from the repo root. The canonical
   command and the aggregate runner both measure against the **repo-root**
   `pyproject.toml` coverage config — that is the number the 90% gate
   enforces. (The runner now hard-fails a 0-collected or below-threshold
   run rather than scoring it green.)
